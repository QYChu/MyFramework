        "在处理骰子掷出时，我们将集合$\\mathcal{S} = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$\n",
        "称为*样本空间*（sample space）或*结果空间*（outcome space），\n",
        "其中每个元素都是*结果*（outcome）。\n",
        "*事件*（event）是一组给定样本空间的随机结果。\n",
        "例如，“看到$5$”（$\\{5\\}$）和“看到奇数”（$\\{1, 3, 5\\}$）都是掷出骰子的有效事件。\n",
        "注意，如果一个随机实验的结果在$\\mathcal{A}$中，则事件$\\mathcal{A}$已经发生。\n",
        "也就是说，如果投掷出$3$点，因为$3 \\in \\{1, 3, 5\\}$，我们可以说，“看到奇数”的事件发生了。\n",
        "\n",
        "*概率*（probability）可以被认为是将集合映射到真实值的函数。\n",
        "在给定的样本空间$\\mathcal{S}$中，事件$\\mathcal{A}$的概率，\n",
        "表示为$P(\\mathcal{A})$，满足以下属性：\n",
        "\n",
        "* 对于任意事件$\\mathcal{A}$，其概率从不会是负数，即$P(\\mathcal{A}) \\geq 0$；\n",
        "* 整个样本空间的概率为$1$，即$P(\\mathcal{S}) = 1$；\n",
        "* 对于*互斥*（mutually exclusive）事件（对于所有$i \\neq j$都有$\\mathcal{A}_i \\cap \\mathcal{A}_j = \\emptyset$）的任意一个可数序列$\\mathcal{A}_1, \\mathcal{A}_2, \\ldots$，序列中任意一个事件发生的概率等于它们各自发生的概率之和，即$P(\\bigcup_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\mathcal{A}_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} P(\\mathcal{A}_i)$。\n",

        "有了这个公理系统，我们可以避免任何关于随机性的哲学争论；\n",
        "相反，我们可以用数学语言严格地推理。\n",

        "### 随机变量\n",
        "\n",
        "在我们掷骰子的随机实验中，我们引入了*随机变量*（random variable）的概念。\n",
        "随机变量几乎可以是任何数量，并且它可以在随机实验的一组可能性中取一个值。\n",
        "考虑一个随机变量$X$，其值在掷骰子的样本空间$\\mathcal{S}=\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$中。\n",
        "我们可以将事件“看到一个$5$”表示为$\\{X=5\\}$或$X=5$，\n",
        "其概率表示为$P(\\{X=5\\})$或$P(X=5)$。\n",
        "通过$P(X=a)$，我们区分了随机变量$X$和$X$可以采取的值（例如$a$）。\n",
        "然而，这可能会导致繁琐的表示。\n",
        "为了简化符号，一方面，我们可以将$P(X)$表示为随机变量$X$上的*分布*（distribution）：\n",
        "分布告诉我们$X$获得某一值的概率。\n",
        "另一方面，我们可以简单用$P(a)$表示随机变量取值$a$的概率。\n",
        "由于概率论中的事件是来自样本空间的一组结果，因此我们可以为随机变量指定值的可取范围。\n",
        "例如，$P(1 \\leq X \\leq 3)$表示事件$\\{1 \\leq X \\leq 3\\}$，\n",
        "即$\\{X = 1, 2, \\text{or}, 3\\}$的概率。\n",
        "等价地，$P(1 \\leq X \\leq 3)$表示随机变量$X$从$\\{1, 2, 3\\}$中取值的概率。\n",
        "\n",
        "请注意，*离散*（discrete）随机变量（如骰子的每一面）\n",
        "和*连续*（continuous）随机变量（如人的体重和身高）之间存在微妙的区别。\n",
        "现实生活中，测量两个人是否具有完全相同的身高没有太大意义。\n",
        "如果我们进行足够精确的测量，最终会发现这个星球上没有两个人具有完全相同的身高。\n",
        "在这种情况下，询问某人的身高是否落入给定的区间，比如是否在1.79米和1.81米之间更有意义。\n",
        "在这些情况下，我们将这个看到某个数值的可能性量化为*密度*（density）。\n",
        "高度恰好为1.80米的概率为0，但密度不是0。\n",
        "在任何两个不同高度之间的区间，我们都有非零的概率。\n",
        "在本节的其余部分中，我们将考虑离散空间中的概率。\n",
        "连续随机变量的概率可以参考深度学习数学附录中[随机变量](https://d2l.ai/chapter_appendix-mathematics-for-deep-learning/random-variables.html)\n",

        "## 处理多个随机变量\n",
        "\n",
        "很多时候，我们会考虑多个随机变量。\n",
        "比如，我们可能需要对疾病和症状之间的关系进行建模。\n",
        "给定一个疾病和一个症状，比如“流感”和“咳嗽”，以某个概率存在或不存在于某个患者身上。\n",
        "我们需要估计这些概率以及概率之间的关系，以便我们可以运用我们的推断来实现更好的医疗服务。\n",
        "\n",
        "再举一个更复杂的例子：图像包含数百万像素，因此有数百万个随机变量。\n",
        "在许多情况下，图像会附带一个*标签*（label），标识图像中的对象。\n",
        "我们也可以将标签视为一个随机变量。\n",
        "我们甚至可以将所有元数据视为随机变量，例如位置、时间、光圈、焦距、ISO、对焦距离和相机类型。\n",
        "所有这些都是联合发生的随机变量。\n",
        "当我们处理多个随机变量时，会有若干个变量是我们感兴趣的。\n",
        "\n",
        "### 联合概率\n",
        "\n",
        "第一个被称为*联合概率*（joint probability）$P(A=a,B=b)$。\n",
        "给定任意值$a$和$b$，联合概率可以回答：$A=a$和$B=b$同时满足的概率是多少？\n",
        "请注意，对于任何$a$和$b$的取值，$P(A = a, B=b) \\leq P(A=a)$。\n",
        "这点是确定的，因为要同时发生$A=a$和$B=b$，$A=a$就必须发生，$B=b$也必须发生（反之亦然）。因此，$A=a$和$B=b$同时发生的可能性不大于$A=a$或是$B=b$单独发生的可能性。\n",
        "\n",
        "### 条件概率\n",
        "\n",
        "联合概率的不等式带给我们一个有趣的比率：\n",
        "$0 \\leq \\frac{P(A=a, B=b)}{P(A=a)} \\leq 1$。\n",
